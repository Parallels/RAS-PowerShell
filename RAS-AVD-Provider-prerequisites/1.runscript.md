# Step1: Running the script

## Description
Parallels RAS provides integration with Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD). There are a few prerequisites that need to be in place in Azure prior to configuring the integration between Parallels RAS and Azure Virtual Desktop [outlined here](https://download.parallels.com/ras/v19/docs/en_US/Parallels-RAS-19-Administrators-Guide/46980.htm). This script configures all the prerequisites in an automated way. The script will ask for Tenant, Subscription, App name, location, resource group name, virtual network, and Keyvault and configures all prerequisites required for the AVD Provider in Parallels RAS. It outputs the information needed to complete the AVD Provider wizard in Parallels RAS.

## Permissions
The script requires Azure AD Global admin permissions as well as Owner permissions in Azure. Upon launching the scripts, you will be asked to logon to both services.

## Using the script

1. Upon launching the PowerShell script, parameters will be collected at runtime. You do not need to pass any command line parameters to the script itself.

2. The script checks which Azure Tenants you have access to, select the Azure Tenant you want to use.

3. The script checks which Azure Subscriptions you have access to, select the Azure Subscription you want to use.

4. The script checks towards which regions you are able to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop. Select the location you want to use.

5. Provide the name of the App Registration you want to create.

<tab><image src=./images/6.png width=50% border=2px>

6. The script checks which Virtual Networks are available in the region you selected. Select the Virtual Networks where Azure Virtual Desktop Sessions hosts and templates will be deployed later.

7.  Provide the name of the Resource Group to create. Inside this Resource Group an Azure Keyvault will be created and it is assumed that Azure Virtual Desktop Session Hosts will later also be deployed here. If Azure Virtual Desktop Session Hosts and/or templates VMs are going to be stored in different Resource Group(s) later, manually add Contributor permissions to those Resource Group for the app registration specified before.

8. Provide the name of the Azure Keyvault to create. The App Registration secret will be safely stored in this Azure Keyvault.

<tab><image src=./images/9.png width=50% border=2px>

9. Upon complication, all prerequisites are in place and the script outputs the parameters to easily provide those in the Parallels RAS Azure Virtual Desktop provider creation wizard. The App Registration secret is securely stored in the Azure Keyvault. If you skipped the Azure Keyvault creation step, make sure to note the App Registration secret in a secure place at this point before you continue.

10. After you press any key to continue, a browser will be opened. Log on with a user that has Azure AD global admin permissions. You will be taken to the App Registration to provide consent on the permissions just created.
