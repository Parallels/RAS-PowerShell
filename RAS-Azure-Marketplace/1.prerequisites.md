# Before you start

Since the Parallels RAS environment must be deployed in an existing Azure Subscription and active Active Directory (Entra ID) environment, a few requirements and permissions need to be in place before deploying Parallels RAS through this template.

## Networking

A Virtual Network (VNet) must be in place in Azure and this VNet must contain a subnet. The Parallels RAS infrastructure machines will be joined to this subnet. Ensure the subnet you create or use has enough space to host the number of infrastructure servers you want to create. For more information about creating and changing a VNet see [Create, change, or delete a virtual network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network).

The VNet must have DNS configured to point to your Domain Controllers (see [Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)](https://docs.parallels.com/parallels-ras-azure-marketplace-deployment-19/introduction/before-you-start/active-directory-domain-services)). For more information about configuring DNS servers on a VNet see [Change DNS servers of a virtual network using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network#change-dns-servers-of-a-virtual-network-using-the-azure-portal).

Create a User Assigned Managed Identity and assign it Contributor Permissions on the Virtual Network you want to use, or on the Resource Group where the VNet resides. For more information about creating a user-assigned managed identity, see [Create a user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).

## Active Directory Domain Services

A healthy running Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) or Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS) must to be in place. Preferably with synchronization to Entra ID, which is a requirement to deploy the Azure Virtual Desktop integration as part of this deployment. The domain controllers must be accessible via the Virtual Network you select to allow Domain Services communication. For more information about creating Domain Controller in Azure, see [Virtualized Domain Controller Deployment and Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/virtualized-domain-controller-deployment-and-configuration). 

To configure Active Directory Domain Services:

1. Create an organizational unit where the Parallels RAS infrastructure servers will be joined to.
![]()

2. Create an account with permission to join computers to the domain. The suggested account name is domainjoin@contoso.com.

3. Create a Security Group and add the administrator accounts to it that will manage and maintain Parallels RAS. This group can be expanded later. The suggested group name is ras-admins@prasmpdemo.com.

## Azure Virtual Machine Quotas

At a minimum, three virtual machines must be created in your Azure Subscription containing Parallels RAS infrastructure roles. You can select VM size to use for each role during the deployment. Make sure you have enough quota in your subscription for the VM sizes you want to use. For more information and guidance on how to view and confirm sufficient VM quotas in Azure follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quotas/view-quotas).
